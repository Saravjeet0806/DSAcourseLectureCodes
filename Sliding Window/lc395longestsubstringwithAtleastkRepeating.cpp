/*Explanation of the Code:
Outer Loop:

We try every possible unique character count in the substring (from 1 to 26).
Sliding Window:

For each uniqueTarget (number of unique characters), we use a sliding window with left and right pointers.
The freq map stores the frequency of characters in the current window.
Expanding the Window:

As we move the right pointer, we add new characters to the frequency map.
If a characterâ€™s frequency becomes equal to k, we increment countAtLeastK.
Shrinking the Window:

If the number of unique characters exceeds uniqueTarget, we shrink the window from the left.
Updating the Answer:

If the number of unique characters matches the number of characters with frequency >= k, we update maxLen.
